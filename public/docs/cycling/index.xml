      <description>Centuries linkAfter using a Garmin training plan to perpare for the event, I was looking forward to a great ride. The ride was great, but it was a mixed bag and the effectiveness of the training is in question. The table below list key metrics on the history of my century rides. Power meteric, which are more important on a macro level, were only availible for a small number of rides.</description>

      <description>Update Equipment link My newest bike is the 2010 Specialize Tarmac Comp. It experianced some frame damage about four or five years ago on a vacation in New England. The bike works, but the finish and coating was damaged which maybe leading to questionable integrty of the frame. The drive componants, headset and wheels were replace in 2017 with Shimano 150 7000 componants. It is still riding, but the headset / front end, is lose and may not be repairable.</description>
