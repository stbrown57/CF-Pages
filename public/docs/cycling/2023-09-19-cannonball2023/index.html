The ride was great, but it was a mixed bag and the effectiveness of the training is in question. The table below list key metrics on the history of my century rides. Power meteric, which are more important on a macro level, were only availible for a small number of rides. The goal of a century is a 20 mph average speed. Obiously a lot of the factors in achiving that are not related to my age and condition, chief among these factors are riding in a appropriate group, terrain and weather.</p>

<p>Some notes on the results: The top entry was the Tour of Richmond almost ten years ago.  In the ride I was with a fast group for about 65 miles at about 21 mph. The final 35 was at about 16.6 mph. The recent ride, 2023, was ranked at 5 of 13, and had many more solo miles.</p>
<h1 id="cannonball-2023-edition">Cannonball 2023 Edition <a href="#cannonball-2023-edition" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h1><p>





  



  
</p>
<p>I was able to break this ride into eight segments based on significant circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="segment-one">Segment One <a href="#segment-one" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>





  



  
</p>
<p>Stage one was a fast adreniline fuled ride right out of the shute. I moved up toward the front relativly early, and although I did not take a turn in the lead, I spent too much time in the two and three spot for a 66 year old. The group passed the first reststop and broke-up somewhat after a hill. I was in the two spot, and the lead was probally putting out too much power. I decieded to wait for Paul and stick with him. Unfortunatly he stopped at the  resetstop and then took a 12 mile deture. I waited for him on the couse quite a while, before going off solo (stage two). I did not know Paul was off in a wrong direction and I waited longer then it would have taken him to get to me, even if he was going slow.  The speed was 22.4 for 18 miles, and it cost me an averave power of 191 watts and a heartrate of 133 bpm. I could have gone further in this situation.</p>
<h2 id="segment-two">Segment Two <a href="#segment-two" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>





  



  
</p>
<p>This stage started with a long reset, actually the longest of the ride. This was the time I was waiting for Paul in vein.  Given that I rode the next 19 Miles at 18.8 mph at a cost slightly above the first stage, 196 watts and average 135 heartrate, I&rsquo;m guessing I could have hung with the fast group up to this point. I would typically consider a solo 19 mile ride at 18.8 pretty good all by itself.</p>
<h2 id="segment-three">Segment Three <a href="#segment-three" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>





  



  
</p>
<p>This segment included a missed turn, some time figuring out that we were lost. Paul lead almost all the time and the segment had a slight downgrade after a steep incline. Overall there was zero ellivation. Our speed was 19.4 mph at a power output of 139 watts and a heartrate of 123.  This was easy because paul was doing the work.</p>
<h2 id="segment-four">Segment Four <a href="#segment-four" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>





  



  
</p>
<p>This part of the ride was again a solo effort of 17.4 miles at 18.1 mph expending an average of 166 watts and heart rate of 138 bpm. The topology was a slight decline with a few ups and downs. Given the lower power output and higher HR, it appears the ride is wareing on me at this point in the ride. This segment ends at 67 miles.</p>
<h2 id="segment-five">Segment Five <a href="#segment-five" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>





  



  
</p>
<p>I was tagging along with the KoreanVelo group after the previous rest stop. They were averaging 21.7 mph and it blow me up at this point in the ride, pretty stupid. Power average was 162, not terribly high (Zone 2), but the average HR was 143 (Zone 5 Intervals.icu). This section was only 3.8 miles. The power average was moderate, but there were a lot of high power bursts and coasting in the group. At 71 miles and change.</p>
<h2 id="segment-six">Segment Six <a href="#segment-six" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>





  



  
</p>
<p>This is were the previous up and down ride with KoreanVelo took its toll.  The next 9.4 miles was riden at a slow speed of 15.4 mph, power was 123 (High Zone 1), and heart rate at 135 (Zone 4). Cadance was also shot, at under 70 rpm. I was cramping and not feeling so good. This was again a solo effort. Ended at about 82 miles.</p>
<h2 id="segment-seven">Segment Seven <a href="#segment-seven" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>





  



  
</p>
<p>This is simply a continuate of degrigated performance. Speed dropped to a 14.8 mph average, power was down even lower into zone 1 (114), heart rate was down to zone 3 (130) and cadence was still poor, below 70. This ended at about the 94 mile mark.</p>
<h2 id="segment-eight">Segment Eight <a href="#segment-eight" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>





  



  
</p>
<p>I picked up a group somewhere alon this streach, to get to the finish. I lost contact with the group on the last incline at about 104. The group was pushing the desent and I crampped badly on the incline. Speed was 17.2 power at 121 (Zone 1) and heart rate was zone 3 (131). It looks like the group bought me a little better than 2.4 mph.</p>
<h1 id="training">Training <a href="#training" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h1><p>





  



  
</p>
<p>The plan started on April 2 with a 24 week duration. There was little if any dynamic element to the plan other than the calculated FTP on the Garmin device. I was able to complete most of the workouts. Some of the harder workouts, particularly a zone 4 2x15, were a little too much.</p>
<p>





  



  
</p>
<p>It look like things were going well for the first 12 weeks, that is nine week in the base stage and three in the build. Then the build was not happening. This may have been the results of over doing it and a few missed days. I never seemed to get back in the grove, possibly because I was using a static plan. It may be benifical to use the Intervals.icu charts along with the Garmin recommendaions to find the improvement.</p>

The ride was great, but it was a mixed bag and the effectiveness of the training is in question. The table below list key metrics on the history of my century rides. Power meteric, which are more important on a macro level, were only availible for a small number of rides. The goal of a century is a 20 mph average speed. Obiously a lot of the factors in achiving that are not related to my age and condition, chief among these factors are riding in a appropriate group, terrain and weather.\nDate Title Distance Time Avg Speed Avg HR Avg Bike Cadence 10/4/2014 Martin’s Tour of Richmond 101.68 5:14:56 19.4 147 83 9/16/2017 Lakes and Grapes 2017 99.97 5:28:42 18.2 130 75 6/8/2019 Lakes and Grapes 2019 99.9 5:29:37 18.2 125 72 9/25/2016 Cannonball 2016 100.76 5:33:26 18.1 130 73 9/16/2023 Cannonball 2023 107.49 6:00:08 17.9 132 74 9/28/2019 Cannonball 2019 99.85 5:37:45 17.7 131 75 9/24/2017 Cannonball Century 2017 100.86 5:41:17 17.7 136 72 9/8/2012 Lake and Grapes Century 106.17 6:00:31 17.7 128 71 9/6/2014 Lakes and Grapes 2014 100.4 5:46:07 17.4 142 81 9/30/2018 Stafford County Road Cycling 100.65 5:49:06 17.3 128 72 9/10/2016 Lakes and Grapes 2016 100.04 5:50:39 17.1 139 71 9/29/2012 Organized with Ben King 101.2 6:16:07 16.1 119 71 9/7/2013 Lakes and Grapes 2013 102.03 7:21:09 13.9 125 78 Some notes on the results: The top entry was the Tour of Richmond almost ten years ago. In the ride I was with a fast group for about 65 miles at about 21 mph. The final 35 was at about 16.6 mph. The recent ride, 2023, was ranked at 5 of 13, and had many more solo miles.\nCannonball 2023 Edition link I was able to break this ride into eight segments based on significant circumstances.\nSegment One link Stage one was a fast adreniline fuled ride right out of the shute. I moved up toward the front relativly early, and although I did not take a turn in the lead, I spent too much time in the two and three spot for a 66 year old. The group passed the first reststop and broke-up somewhat after a hill. I was in the two spot, and the lead was probally putting out too much power. I decieded to wait for Paul and stick with him. Unfortunatly he stopped at the resetstop and then took a 12 mile deture. I waited for him on the couse quite a while, before going off solo (stage two). I did not know Paul was off in a wrong direction and I waited longer then it would have taken him to get to me, even if he was going slow. The speed was 22.4 for 18 miles, and it cost me an averave power of 191 watts and a heartrate of 133 bpm. I could have gone further in this situation.\nSegment Two link This stage started with a long reset, actually the longest of the ride. This was the time I was waiting for Paul in vein. Given that I rode the next 19 Miles at 18.8 mph at a cost slightly above the first stage, 196 watts and average 135 heartrate, I’m guessing I could have hung with the fast group up to this point. I would typically consider a solo 19 mile ride at 18.8 pretty good all by itself.\nSegment Three link This segment included a missed turn, some time figuring out that we were lost. Paul lead almost all the time and the segment had a slight downgrade after a steep incline. Overall there was zero ellivation. Our speed was 19.4 mph at a power output of 139 watts and a heartrate of 123. This was easy because paul was doing the work.\nSegment Four link This part of the ride was again a solo effort of 17.4 miles at 18.1 mph expending an average of 166 watts and heart rate of 138 bpm. The topology was a slight decline with a few ups and downs. Given the lower power output and higher HR, it appears the ride is wareing on me at this point in the ride. This segment ends at 67 miles.\nSegment Five link I was tagging along with the KoreanVelo group after the previous rest stop. They were averaging 21.7 mph and it blow me up at this point in the ride, pretty stupid. Power average was 162, not terribly high (Zone 2), but the average HR was 143 (Zone 5 Intervals.icu). This section was only 3.8 miles. The power average was moderate, but there were a lot of high power bursts and coasting in the group. At 71 miles and change.\nSegment Six link This is were the previous up and down ride with KoreanVelo took its toll. The next 9.4 miles was riden at a slow speed of 15.4 mph, power was 123 (High Zone 1), and heart rate at 135 (Zone 4). Cadance was also shot, at under 70 rpm. I was cramping and not feeling so good. This was again a solo effort. Ended at about 82 miles.\nSegment Seven link This is simply a continuate of degrigated performance. Speed dropped to a 14.8 mph average, power was down even lower into zone 1 (114), heart rate was down to zone 3 (130) and cadence was still poor, below 70. This ended at about the 94 mile mark.\nSegment Eight link I picked up a group somewhere alon this streach, to get to the finish. I lost contact with the group on the last incline at about 104. The group was pushing the desent and I crampped badly on the incline. Speed was 17.2 power at 121 (Zone 1) and heart rate was zone 3 (131). It looks like the group bought me a little better than 2.4 mph.\nTraining link The plan started on April 2 with a 24 week duration. There was little if any dynamic element to the plan other than the calculated FTP on the Garmin device. I was able to complete most of the workouts. Some of the harder workouts, particularly a zone 4 2x15, were a little too much.\nIt look like things were going well for the first 12 weeks, that is nine week in the base stage and three in the build. Then the build was not happening. This may have been the results of over doing it and a few missed days. I never seemed to get back in the grove, possibly because I was using a static plan. It may be benifical to use the Intervals.icu charts along with the Garmin recommendaions to find the improvement.\n"

                content: "Update Equipment link My newest bike is the 2010 Specialize Tarmac Comp. It experianced some frame damage about four or five years ago on a vacation in New England. The bike works, but the finish and coating was damaged which maybe leading to questionable integrty of the frame. The drive componants, headset and wheels were replace in 2017 with Shimano 150 7000 componants. It is still riding, but the headset / front end, is lose and may not be repairable. I’ve had good times with the bike, but the frame is probably ready for the landfill.\nMy next bike will problally not be my last, I’m guessing there will be an E-assist in my future retirement years, for now I am looking for a reasonalble bike with electronic shifting and disk brakes. I am beinging to realize that Aero and racing frames look way cool, but they are not going to be worth the money at my level. So I’m looking for an endurance bike. I’ve looked at a few major brands, but the best deal seems to be Canyon CF 7.

This is possibly a network connectivity problem with the cluster networking (flannel).\nLook - FedoraCore linkThere is an issue with systemd-resolvers, and Kubernette that may cause a loop and fail to forward queries to the external DNS, typically defined in the /etc/resolv.conf file. A suggested resolution is to add a flag to the k3s service definition (kubernet/k3s program). Entering the following may resolve the problem. I believe these flags can be add to a configuration file for k3s instead of the systemd service definition.\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/k3s \\ agent \\ 'resolv-conf' \\ '/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf' \\ '--selinux' \\ Canyon - Armbian (Debian based ARM distro) linkThis default configuration seems to work as expected. Queries for external hosts though nslookup require a terminating dot. If it is not terminated the search domain is appended.\nroot@dnsutils:/# nslookup google.com Server:\t10.43.0.10 Address:\t10.43.0.10#53 Non-authoritative answer: Name:\tgoogle.com.6browns.org Address: 173.72.245.3 This could be happening because the upstream DNS server (colnago.6browns.org - dnsmasq) is responding with the public IP for any unknown host on the 6browns.org domain.\nFrom a k3s issue thread…\nIn addition to configuring k3s with environment variables and cli arguments, k3s can also use a config file. By default, values present in a yaml file located at /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml will be used on install. An example of a basic server config file is below: # /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml write-kubeconfig-mode: \"0644\" tls-san: - \"foo.local\" node-label: - \"foo=bar\" - \"something=amazing\" In general, cli arguments map to their respective yaml key, with repeatable cli args being represented as yaml lists. An identical configuration using solely cli arguments is shown below to demonstrate this: k3s server \\ --write-kubeconfig-mode \"0644\" \\ --tls-san \"foo.local\" \\ --node-label \"foo=bar\" \\ --node-label \"something=amazing\" It is also possible to use both a configuration file and cli arguments. In these situations, values will be loaded from both sources, but cli arguments will take precedence. For repeatable arguments such as --node-label, the cli arguments will overwrite all values in the list. Dig seems to work as expected. This may just be the way it works.\n"

Knowing the limits of the system through testing will help define an alerting system for production monitoring and help define strategist for expanding the capacities of these systems. Alerting will notify operators of potential impending problems, a change in workflow, and triggers to capacity changes.\nMetric Collection link Prometheus and Grafana\nA Prometheus server was installed on “DeRosa” with “node_exporters” on each of the other systems running in the environment. The results are very cool in the simple load monitoring initially configured. Prometheus does not store logs, so another method will be required either in addition to the Prometheus data store or as a replacement. Rancher Rio includes both Prometheus and Grafana in the stack. Loki is Grafana log analysis application The “TICK” stack (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor) may be a workable alternative. InfluxDB accepts strings in time series, which has been use to store logs. Chronograf may be an alternative to Grafana. Log Collection and Analysis linkThere are a lot of reasons for collecting and analyzing logs and ultimately there is probably no single method in addressing these needs. I looks like Fluentd was developed to cope with this problem. Fluentd is a kind of log router and translator. It takes logs from many sources and forwards them to backend engins for storage and analysis. Elasticsearch, AlienVault, and object stores.\nTICK stack Syslog and something to analize, alert and archive Other Monitoring Systems linkThis listening seems to be a mixed bag of traditional SNMP monitoring applications along with some cloud based metric monitoring.\nNetData linkCollect SoC temp\nThe old BASH module can be used for this.\nTo enable the old BASH module do these:\nDisable sensors for python.d.plugin by editing /etc/netdata/python.d.conf and setting sensors: no.

Identify the device /dev/ttyUSB#, and connect a Screen instance:\nscreen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 Power on the ClusterBoard, it looks like a SD card is required to begin the boot process. The console should display the boot log as the process proceeds. In my case the Armbian image did not boot.\nBoot Image linkI initially I tried an Armbian Buster image for the Sopine64 board. I got output, but the system ultimately ended up in the uboot environment. The first step in the diagnostic process is capturing the boot log messages for a little more detail, this will most likely be done with screen. There appear to be three possible images / systems that may be possible to boot. The most likely image Armbian Sopine, and, possibility Alpine. Ultimately K3os with replace the root partition image.\nARM64 images seem to include DTB files that I believe define the components need for particular boards. The Armbian image includes the file “sun50i-a64-sophie-baseboard.dtb” this certainly looks encouraging.\nAlpine linkMost of the package for the K3os install are from this disro, so it may be the best option for a bootable kernel.\nArmbian linkThis is the most likely bootable image. The image booted with not network, this may be a known issue. Resetting the board and reconnecting the network connection seem to resolve the problem. There maybe some I/O errors on the mSD card.\nI’ve used a few combinations of images and techniques for the boot process, however many have failed somewhere alone the line. This is what I have so far:\nsopine1 is up using Armbian, but I don’t remember which image. (Probably Bionic) sopine0\nArmbian Bionic image for Pine64so on an mSSD. This seems to boot. The same image on the eMMC hangs at “Starting kernel…”. It looks like U-Boot is working but “boot.scr” seems to be incorrect. Another option for the base system seems to be the OpenEnbedded build sysetm.\nK3os linkUltimately this is the image that should be installed in the cluster and will be managed by the K3s system, but it looks like it will require a bootable kernel for installation.\nRunning the following on a bootable Armbian images seems to have worked. There is no console messages once the image switches to the root partition, and no tty console, however ssh with the configured rancher user (config.yaml) worked.\ncurl -sfL https://github.com/rancher/k3os/releases/download/v0.8.0/k3os-rootfs-arm64.tar.gz| tar zxvf - --strip-components=1 -C / cp myconfig.yaml /k3os/system/config.yaml sync reboot -f config.yaml\nssh_authorized_keys: - ssh-rsa \u003c...\u003e= sbrown@bianchi hostname: sopine# run_cmd: - \"echo hi \u0026\u0026 echo bye\" boot_cmd: - \"echo hi \u0026\u0026 echo bye\" init_cmd: - \"echo hi \u0026\u0026 echo bye\" k3os: data_sources: - cdrom dns_nameservers: - 8.8.8.8 - 1.1.1.1 ntp_servers: - 0.us.pool.ntp.org - 1.us.pool.ntp.org password: rancher Add config.yaml to the worker node’s /var/lib/rancher/k3os directory to join the cluster\nk3os: server_url: https://sopine0.6browns.org:6443 token: K101263c79eda3447e2e671f4f59a99914a989c44684dfc2fd121bbb3cc57d4b0e8::server:0d33b0dbf4499e27bafd7a28cd99a2c8 Rio linkRio is a layered product on the Rancher K3s infrastructure that provides a micro Platform as a Service (uPaaS).

Option three (downstream TLS, upstream plain), this may be an option for external access, but again browsers do not seem to like unencrypted connection that are designed in this model with internal connections. I will look at this option, because it is the easiest and will provide a good start.\nTLS Offloading (downstream is TLS protected, upstream is plain) linkThis option will ultimately not be as useful as the two fully encrypted options, but it may have limited use and it will be the easiest to configure and test.\nCreate a HTTP target\nUse NGINX-app as the target, this instance resides in the “dev” namespace.

It will encrypt traffic both into the GW and from the GW to the target. The downstream encryption will use a Let’s Encrypt certificate as previous described.

First the Cloudflare configuration for DNS-01 verification had to be reconfigured. Next I was receiving a 404 error from the curl test on the AWS instance. For whatever reason I had to edit the NGINX.conf file to change the proxy_pass directive from http to https.\nThe day after a successful connection, I started to get 505 errors. Looking at the “HTTP error” logs, it appeared the interconnection failed due to an untrusted certificate. Curl on the GW works since I added the bfnet-ca to the trusted file “CAfile: /usr/local/etc/ssl/cert.pem”. I’m guessing the NGINX system is not using this ROOT CA. Manually setting the configuration proxy_verify=off resolved the problem, but I will need to have the internal certs trusted by the NGINX implementation.\nupstream upstreambdc14352f04040f6864d11a0766a6153 { server whoami.k3s.6browns.org:443 weight=1; } ... proxy_pass **https**://upstreambdc14352f04040f6864d11a0766a6153; TLS Passthough linkThere may be instances where the secure channel can not be broken as was configured above.
